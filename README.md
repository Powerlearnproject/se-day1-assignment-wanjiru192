# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.

reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering complexity
Mastering process
mastering machine

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

planning:identifying the software requirement
requirement analysis;identifying final user specifications
designing;building the framework
coding;converting the software design to tangible code
testing;examine the sofware for any bugs
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

waterfall methodology:each phase is completed before moving on hence low flexibility
agile methodology:contains multiple sprints hence high flexibility
Describe the roles and responsibilties of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer:develops applications,program and systems using programming languages
quality assurance engineer:understands and clarifies software requirements
project manager:assembles and leads the sotware development team
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

(IDE)-intergrated development environment is a platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by provoding place to write,debug and
version control systems:software tools that help the software teams to manage changes to source code over time
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

collaboration: enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflict
change tracking:records detailed historyof changes allowing easy analysis of each modifocation.

Explain the different types of sting (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit tests:testing individual methods and functions of classes,components or modules used by your software.also ensures each unit perfoms its inteded function correctly

system testing:focus onthe entire system as a whole including all functionalities and interactions
acceptance:formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
